## Preface {.unnumbered}

I've always been looking for the tool that would help
technical and scholarly writing flow in a Markdown-driven way.
Managing figures, tables, equations, and bibliographies.
Generating html, latex, or pdf.

I had my own previous hand-rolled projects to do this:
[markdown-memo](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-memo),
which I was trying to update and trim down into
[markdown-easy](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy).

Then I discovered the [quarto](https://quarto.org)
project that is very similar in spirit and has already
accomplished what I was trying to get to.
And they have a growing community.
